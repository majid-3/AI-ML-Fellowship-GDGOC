# 🧮 Streamlit Calculator

A web-based interactive calculator built with Python and Streamlit. This app supports **basic arithmetic**, **trigonometric functions**, **complex number operations**, and **conversion between rectangular and polar forms**.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build a fully functional Python project with:  

- Clean and modular code   
- Error handling (division by zero, undefined tan, etc.)  
- Git/GitHub collaboration  
- Streamlit app deployment  
- Well-documented code  

---

## 💻 Features

### 1️⃣ Arithmetic
- Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide
- Handles division by zero  

### 2️⃣ Trigonometry
- Sine (`sin`), Cosine (`cos`), Tangent (`tan`)  
- Input in degrees  
- Handles undefined values  

### 3️⃣ Complex Numbers
- Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide  
- Conversion between:
  - Rectangular → Polar form  
  - Polar → Rectangular form

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Streamlit for web app interface  
- `math` and `cmath` modules for calculations  

---
## 📌 Usage

- Navigate through tabs to select functionality:
  - **Arithmetic**: perform basic operations
  - **Trigonometry**: calculate sin, cos, tan of an angle
  - **Complex Numbers**: perform operations on complex numbers or convert between rectangular and polar forms

- Click the respective **Calculate** or **Convert** button in each tab to see results.
