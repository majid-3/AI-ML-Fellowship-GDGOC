## What I Learned

- Basics of Python programming and syntax  
- How to take user input and display output  
- Use of conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Use of loops (`while`) for repetitive tasks  
- Writing simple programs such as:
  - Area of a circle
  - Factorial calculation
  - String reversal
  - Number guessing game
- Writing clean, readable code with proper comments  
- Organizing projects using a proper folder structure  
- Basic Git and GitHub workflow (add, commit, push)

## How to Run the Programs

- Install **Python** and make sure it is added to your system PATH  
  - Verify installation using: `python --version`
- Open **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**  
- Open the project folder: `AI-ML-Fellowship-GDGOC-Atk`  
- Navigate to the specific task folder in the Explorer  
  - Example: `Week1-PythonFoundation/Task1`
- Open the Python file you want to run  
  - Example: `area_of_circle.py`
- Install the **Code Runner extension** from the VS Code marketplace  
- Press the **Run Code icon** (▶️) at the top right of the editor  
- Enter inputs as prompted in the **output window** and see the results  
- Repeat the same steps for other task files in their respective folders  
  - Task2 → `factorial.py`  
  - Task3 → `String_reverse.py`  
  - Task4 → `number_guessing_game.py`
