# AI, ML, DL, Data Science, and LLMs – Overview

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence is a broad field of computer science focused on building machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence, such as learning, decision-making, and problem-solving.

## Machine Learning (ML)
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from past data instead of being explicitly programmed. ML uses algorithms to identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions about future outcomes.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning where the model is trained using **labeled data**. This means each input has a known output. The model learns by comparing its predictions with the correct answers.  

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning where the data is **not labeled**. The model tries to discover hidden patterns, structures, or groupings within the data.  

## Deep Learning (DL)
Deep Learning is a specialized subset of Machine Learning that uses multi-layered neural networks inspired by the human brain. It is highly effective for complex and unstructured data such as images, speech, and text.

## Data Science (DS)
Data Science combines mathematics, statistics, programming, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and domain knowledge to extract meaningful insights from data and support informed decision-making.

## Large Language Models (LLMs)
Large Language Models are deep learning models designed to understand and generate human language.  
**GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)** is a well-known family of LLMs developed by OpenAI and is widely used in applications such as chatbots, content generation, and intelligent decision-support systems.
