# 🚢 Titanic Dataset Analysis

This Notebook explores and analyzes the **Titanic dataset** using Python. The notebook focuses on understanding the dataset, handling missing values, and performing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) through visualizations.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including whether they survived or not. It includes both numerical and categorical features.

**Key features include:**
- `Survived` – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Pclass` – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- `Sex` – Gender of the passenger
- `Age` – Age of the passenger
- `SibSp` – Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- `Parch` – Number of parents/children aboard
- `Fare` – Ticket fare
- `Embarked` – Port of embarkation

📌 The dataset is commonly used for learning **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning basics**.
